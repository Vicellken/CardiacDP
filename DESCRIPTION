Description: An algorithm developed to efficiently and accurately process complex and variable cardiac data with three key features: 1. employing autocorrelation to identify recurrent heartbeats and use their periods to compute heart rates; 2. incorporating a genetic algorithm framework to minimize data loss due to noise interference and accommodate within-sequence variations; and 3. introducing a tracking index as a moving reference to reduce errors.
